# PlantNet39🌱
PlantNet39 is a deep learning model for detecting **39 different classes of plant leaf diseases.**

This project extends my previous work on a 3-class model using ViT(Vision Transformer) and EfficientNet-B2, where I compared model sizes and deployability. EfficientNet-B2 was chosen for **lightweight deployment** while maintaining high accuracy.
